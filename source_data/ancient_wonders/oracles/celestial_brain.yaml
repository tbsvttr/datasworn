          Use this oracle if you want to determine when an event occurs. If you already know that an event happened in the past or future, reference the Determined Continuity column. Otherwise, reference the Undetermined Continuity column.

          There are "when" questions that this oracle might not be suitable for answering, such as "When did the precursor civilizations fall" or "When will the universe end". In such cases, you may still use the oracle below solely for vaguely past or future answers but not specific time scales.
