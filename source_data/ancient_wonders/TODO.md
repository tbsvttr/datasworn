# Ancient Wonders - Data Quality Issues

Feedback from southpole regarding converter-generated data.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Missing Focus Table
- `splinter_focus` exists in the data
- May be missing a core "Focus" oracle that other content references
- Text references "_Focus_ oracle" suggesting a link to `starforged/core/focus`

### 2. Table Ordering
Tables are not in book order. They appear to be sorted alphabetically or by some automatic ordering from the converter rather than matching the physical book's structure.

**Fix**: Add `_index` fields to control ordering, or restructure the YAML to match book order.

### 3. Missing Planet Hierarchy
Current structure is flat:
```
oracles.planets_expanded.contents:
  - desert_world_atmosphere
  - desert_world_biome
  - desert_world_life
  - furnace_world_atmosphere
  - furnace_world_biome
  ...
```

Should match Starforged's hierarchical structure:
```
oracles.planet.collections:
  - desert/
    - contents: [atmosphere, biome, life, ...]
  - furnace/
    - contents: [atmosphere, biome, life, ...]
```

**Fix**: Reorganize planet tables into nested collections per planet type.

### 4. Missing Links (Critical)
**Zero `datasworn:` links exist in the oracles file!**

Many text references should be clickable links:
- `"_Action_ oracle"` → `[Action](datasworn:oracle_rollable:starforged/core/action)`
- `"_Theme_ oracle"` → `[Theme](datasworn:oracle_rollable:starforged/core/theme)`
- `"_Focus_ oracle"` → `[Focus](datasworn:oracle_rollable:starforged/core/focus)`
- `"Shape oracle on page 102"` → link to shape oracle
- `"page 40"`, `"page 72"` etc. → links to relevant oracles
- `">Planet"` → proper datasworn link

Examples of text that needs linking:
```yaml
text: "Use the following tables to determine... you may use the Shape oracle on page 102"
text: "Roll >Planet (page 40) to generate its features"
text: "roll >Planetary Class on page 41"
```

**Fix**: Add `datasworn:` protocol links throughout the content.

## Task List

- [ ] Identify and add missing Focus oracle (or verify it's `splinter_focus`)
- [ ] Add `_index` fields or restructure YAML to match book ordering
- [ ] Reorganize `planets_expanded` into hierarchical collections
- [ ] Add datasworn: links for all cross-references:
  - [x] Core oracle references (_Action_, _Theme_, _Focus_, _Descriptor_)
  - [ ] Page number references (convert to oracle IDs)
  - [ ] `>Oracle` syntax references
  - [ ] Planet class references
  - [ ] Starforged/Sundered Isles references ("SI, pg 250" etc.)

## Notes

This content was generated by a converter tool. Manual review and editing is needed to bring it up to the quality level of official Datasworn content.
