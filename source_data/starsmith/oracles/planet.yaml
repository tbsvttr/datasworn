              An arid land devoid of most life stretches around the globe. If there
              is any vegetation, it is sparse at best as few plants can survive the
              choking sandstorms. Rocky sea beds now filled with sand hint that water
              once covered large areas of the surface centuries or millennia ago. The
              utter desolation is forbidding.

              Volcanic ruptures dot the surface of this planet allowing lava, ash
              and gas to escape from magma chambers deep within the core. The sheer
              volume of fiery lava casts an eerie red glow onto anything in orbit. Steam
              swirls through the Atmosphere creating massive weather systems.

              This world was once home to a robust civilization but is now nothing
              more than a desiccated husk. Ruins, battlefields, and disconcerting silence
              cover the surface. Did anyone make it off-world before the end?

              A world blanketed in snow, winter has come and never leaves. Vast
              tundras sprawl across the surface while continent-sized glaciers carve
              out whole mountain ranges. Even from orbit it is difficult to tell whether
              one area is a landmass or just a large snowstorm. Parts of the ocean flash
              froze leaving waves of ice behind.

              Dense gases make up discernible and colorful layers on the way down
              to this planet’s tiny core of dense rock and magma. Storms perpetually
              rage in the Atmosphere with constant winds blowing at hurricane force
              or greater. It is said that some individual storms have lasted for centuries.

              Dense forests and tangled vegetation cover more primeval growth from
              millennia past all over the surface of this planet. Life here is savage
              and fierce, fighting to thrive and not just survive. What secrets the
              rain-soaked canopy hides is anyone’s guess, but the diversity of life
              here suggests there will indeed be secrets.

              of other thalassogen such as ammonia, lava, or hydrocarbons. Other ocean
              worlds have their worlds contained between two icy spheres: a top layer

              dominates on their surface can be silicon-based or carbon-based. Either
              type of surface can be hostile to life and treacherous to traverse. These

              and debris orbit around larger sections of the remaining partial planet.
              The planetary core is no longer in tact and bleeds out into space. What
              caused this destruction is unknown, but if it is still around, it is surely
              dangerous.

              planet. Whether a civilization greedily consumed the planetary resources
              thereby polluting the world or a dangerous micro-organism proliferated
              rapidly, the result is the same: a planet of death."

              tiny pockets of hope can be found, and this planet offers that. Liquid
              water exists here which has given a chance for both flora and fauna to
              flourish. If you can’t find exactly what you need here, you can at least
              find a moment of respite.
